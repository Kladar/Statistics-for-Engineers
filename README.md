# Statistics-for-Engineers
Collection of the R scripts, figures, and other files associated with engineering statistics course I took while studying at the Technical University of Denmark

## Included in this all my work on the Skive Fjord nutrient loading. It includes:

R was used for data analysis throughout which ultimately led to two reports on nutrient loading in the Fjord. Examples of plots (time series, histogram, residuals, Q-Q, and others), conversion of statistics equations to code, and statistical hypothesis testing.

Skive Fjord 1 and 2 contain the reports generated using the given data. 

1. A basic statistics and a linear regression model of two variables, chlorophyll concentrations and phosphorus concentrations.
2. A normal Q-Q plot of the actual data compared to the linear regression model including residuals analysis
3. Hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and error analysis of future measurements.

The course was unstructured and self-taught from the textbook. Each project was submitted and graded to move on to the next section. I completed the course with a perfect score (12/12 grade in Denmark).
